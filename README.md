This project is a Python-based vehicle counting system that uses OpenCV to detect and count vehicles in a video stream. The program processes each frame to identify moving vehicles and counts them as they cross a specified line. This is done through background subtraction, morphological transformations, and contour detection.

Features
Counts vehicles in real-time as they cross a designated counting line.
Uses background subtraction to distinguish moving vehicles from the static background.
Displays a real-time count of vehicles and shows bounding boxes around detected vehicles.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
