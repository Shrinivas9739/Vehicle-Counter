This project is a Python-based vehicle counting system that uses OpenCV to detect and count vehicles in a video stream. The program processes each frame to identify moving vehicles and counts them as they cross a specified line. This is done through background subtraction, morphological transformations, and contour detection.

Features:

1)Counts vehicles in real-time as they cross a designated counting line.
2)Uses background subtraction to distinguish moving vehicles from the static background.
3)Displays a real-time count of vehicles and shows bounding boxes around detected vehicles.

Prerequisites:

1)Python 3.x
2)OpenCV
3)NumPy

I)Install the required packages by running:
pip install opencv-python numpy
